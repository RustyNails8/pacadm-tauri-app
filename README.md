  build-essential \
  curl \
  wget \
  file \
  libxdo-dev \

#### Install Rustup
```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```
Reboot the system again

The html and css is located in the src folder, if you want to, you can use javascript as well.
Note: Iframes may have issues with some sites.
```sh
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

### Changing the Icon
```sh
npm install
npm run tauri icon your-icon.png
```
### Building a release locally
```sh
npm install
npm run tauri build
```
### Workflows
Workflows can be used to automatically compile and release your code.
This is an [example](.github/workflows/main.yml)

### Building a Snap
1. Go to snapcraft.io and create an account
2. Reserve an app name
3. Change all instances of `yourapp` to the name of your app
4. Add a summary and description to your app
5. Once your app name has been approved on snapcraft.io you can click on your app and then click on the builds tab.
6. When in the build tabs you can link your git repository to it and trigger a build.
7. When the build is successful you can go into `releases` and drag your release from latest/edge to latest/stable.
